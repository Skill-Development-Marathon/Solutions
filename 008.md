# [1641. Count Sorted Vowel Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-sorted-vowel-strings/description/)
**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

Given an integer n, return the number of strings of length n that consist only of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and are lexicographically sorted.

A string s is lexicographically sorted if for all valid i, s[i] is the same as or comes before s[i+1] in the alphabet.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: n = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: The 5 sorted strings that consist of vowels only are ["a","e","i","o","u"].
```
**Example 2:**

```text
Input: n = 2
Output: 15
Explanation: The 15 sorted strings that consist of vowels only are
["aa","ae","ai","ao","au","ee","ei","eo","eu","ii","io","iu","oo","ou","uu"].
Note that "ea" is not a valid string since 'e' comes after 'a' in the alphabet.
```
**Example 3:**
```text
Input: n = 33
Output: 66045
```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= n <= 50`
