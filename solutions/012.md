# [12. Integer to Roman](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-roman/)

**Difficulty:**  :yellow_circle: Medium

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```text
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added 
together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27`
is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. 
However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is 
written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making 
four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`.
There are six instances where subtraction is used:

`I` can be placed before `V` (`5`) and `X` (`10`) to make `4` and `9`. 
`X` can be placed before `L` (`50`) and `C` (`100`) to make `40` and `90`. 
`C` can be placed before `D` (`500`) and `M` (`1000`) to make `400` and `900`.
Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: num = 3
Output: "III"
Explanation: 3 is represented as 3 ones.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: num = 58
Output: "LVIII"
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: num = 1994
Output: "MCMXCIV"
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= num <= 3999`


## Solutions

### Simple of solution 

#### Simple solution in Python3
```python3
def intToRoman(self, num: int) -> str:
        mapping = {
            1000: “M”,
            900: “CM”,
            500: “D”,
            400: “CD”,
            100: “C”,
            90: “XC”,
            50: “L”,
            40: “XL”, 
            10: “X”, 
            9: “IX”,
            5: “V”, 
            4: “IV”, 
            1: “I”
        }
        result = []
        for key in sorted(mapping.keys(), reverse=True):
            if key <= num:
                result.append(mapping[key] * (num // key))
                num %= key
        return “”.join(result)
```
