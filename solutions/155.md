1475. Final Prices With a Special Discount in a Shop
**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy| :yellow_circle: Medium| :red_circle: Hard

problem_here
You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of the ith item in a shop.

There is a special discount for items in the shop. If you buy the ith item, then you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[j] where j is the minimum index such that j > i and prices[j] <= prices[i]. Otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.

Return an integer array answer where answer[i] is the final price you will pay for the ith item of the shop, considering the special discount.
## Examples:
Example 1:

Input: prices = [8,4,6,2,3]
Output: [4,2,4,2,3]
Explanation: 
For item 0 with price[0]=8 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[1]=4, therefore, the final price you will pay is 8 - 4 = 4.
For item 1 with price[1]=4 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 4 - 2 = 2.
For item 2 with price[2]=6 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 6 - 2 = 4.
For items 3 and 4 you will not receive any discount at all.

```def finalPrices(self, prices: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        l = len(prices)
        result = []
        for i in range(l):
            for j in range(1,l):
                if j > i and prices[i] >= prices[j]:
                    result.append(prices[i]-prices[j])
                    break
            else:
                result.append(prices[i])
        return result
