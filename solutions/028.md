# [2161. Partition Array According to Given Pivot](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-according-to-given-pivot/description/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy| :yellow_circle: Medium| :red_circle: Hard

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `pivot`. 
Rearrange `nums` such that the following conditions are satisfied:

- Every element less than `pivot` appears **before** every element greater 
than `pivot`.
- Every element equal to `pivot` appears **in between** the elements less 
than and greater than `pivot`.
- The **relative order** of the elements less than `pivot` and the elements 
greater than `pivot` is maintained.
- More formally, consider every `pi`, `pj` where `pi` is the new position 
of the `ith` element and `pj` is the new position of the `jth` element. For 
elements less than `pivot`, if `i < j` and `nums[i] < pivot` and 
`nums[j] < pivot`, then `pi < pj`. Similarly for elements greater than 
`pivot`, if `i < j` and `nums[i] > pivot` and `nums[j] > pivot`, then `pi < pj`.

Return `nums` *after the rearrangement.*

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [9,12,5,10,14,3,10], pivot = 10
Output: [9,5,3,10,10,12,14]
Explanation: 
The elements 9, 5, and 3 are less than the pivot so they are on the left side of the array.
The elements 12 and 14 are greater than the pivot so they are on the right side of the array.
The relative ordering of the elements less than and greater than pivot is also maintained. [9, 5, 3] and [12, 14] are the respective orderings.

```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [-3,4,3,2], pivot = 2
Output: [-3,2,4,3]
Explanation: 
The element -3 is less than the pivot so it is on the left side of the array.
The elements 4 and 3 are greater than the pivot so they are on the right side of the array.
The relative ordering of the elements less than and greater than pivot is also maintained. [-3] and [4, 3] are the respective orderings.

```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-106 <= nums[i] <= 106`
- `pivot` equals to an element of `nums`.

## Solutions

### O(n) solution

The given algorithm takes a list of integers `nums` and a pivot value as input and returns a new list where the elements are rearranged such that all numbers less than the pivot appear first, followed by the equal numbers, and then the numbers greater than the pivot.

1. The algorithm defines a class `Solution` with a method `pivotArray` that takes `nums` and `pivot` as parameters and returns a list of integers.
2. Inside the `pivotArray` method, the algorithm initializes two empty lists:
   - `less` will store the numbers less than the pivot.
   - `great` will store the numbers greater than the pivot.
3. The algorithm also initializes a variable `equal_count` to keep track of the count of numbers that are equal to the pivot.
4. The algorithm starts a loop that iterates over each element `n` in the `nums` list.
5. Within the loop, the algorithm checks if the current element `n` is less than the pivot. If it is, the element is appended to the `less` list.
6. If the current element `n` is greater than the pivot, it is appended to the `great` list.
7. If the current element `n` is equal to the pivot, the `equal_count` variable is incremented by 1.
8. After iterating over all the elements in `nums`, the algorithm returns a new list that concatenates the `less` list, followed by `pivot` repeated `equal_count` times, and then the `great` list.

**Complexity Analysis**

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input list `nums`. This is because the algorithm iterates over each element in the list once.

The space complexity is O(n), as the algorithm utilizes additional space to store the `less` and `great` lists, which can have a size equal to or slightly smaller than the input list `nums` in the worst case.

#### Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def pivotArray(self, nums: List[int], pivot: int) -> List[int]:
        less, great = [], []
        equal_count = 0
        for n in nums:
            if n < pivot:
                less.append(n)
            elif n > pivot:
                great.append(n)
            else:
                equal_count += 1

        return less+[pivot]*equal_count+great
```
