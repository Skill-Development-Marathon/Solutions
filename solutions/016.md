# [2221. Find Triangular Sum of an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-triangular-sum-of-an-array/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` is a digit between `0` and `9` (**inclusive**).

The triangular sum of `nums` is the value of the only element present in `nums` after the following process terminates:

Let `nums` comprise of `n` elements. If `n == 1`, **end** the process. Otherwise, **create** a new **0-indexed** integer array `newNums` of length `n - 1`.
For each index `i`, where `0 <= i < n - 1`, assign the value of `newNums[i] as (nums[i] + nums[i+1]) % 10`, where `%` denotes modulo operator.
**Replace** the array **nums** with **newNums**.
**Repeat** the entire process starting from step `1`.
Return the triangular sum of `nums`.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 8
Explanation:
The above diagram depicts the process from which we obtain the triangular sum of the array.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [5]
Output: 5
Explanation:
Since there is only one element in nums, the triangular sum is the value of that element itself.
```


## Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 9`


## Solutions

### O(n) solution

We will start iterating over `nums` at postion 1 and add current value at `i` to `i-1` until.
In each cycle until `nums` array will have only one element left we will pop last element which is not affected.

#### Python3
```python3
class Solution:
    def triangularSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        while len(nums) != 1:
            for i in range(1, len(nums)):
                nums[i-1] = (nums[i-1]+nums[i])%10
            nums.pop()
        return nums[0]
```
