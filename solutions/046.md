# [382. Linked List Random Node](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-random-node/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

Given a singly linked list, return a random node's value from the linked list. Each node must have the **same probability** of being chosen.

Implement the `Solution` class:

- `Solution(ListNode head)` Initializes the object with the head of the singly-linked list `head`.
- `int getRandom()` Chooses a node randomly from the list and returns its value. All the nodes of the list should be equally likely to be chosen.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

![046_01.jpg](./resources/046_01.jpg)

```
Input
["Solution", "getRandom", "getRandom", "getRandom", "getRandom", "getRandom"]
[[[1, 2, 3]], [], [], [], [], []]
Output
[null, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 2, 3]);
solution.getRandom(); // return 1
solution.getRandom(); // return 3
solution.getRandom(); // return 2
solution.getRandom(); // return 2
solution.getRandom(); // return 3
// getRandom() should return either 1, 2, or 3 randomly. Each element should have equal probability of returning.

```

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the linked list will be in the range `[1, 104]`.
- `104 <= Node.val <= 104`
- At most `104` calls will be made to `getRandom`.

## Follow up:

- What if the linked list is extremely large and its length is unknown to you?
- Could you solve this efficiently without using extra space?

## Solutions

### O(n) solution 

#### Python3
```python3
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

import random

class Solution:

    def __init__(self, head: Optional[ListNode]):
        self._head = head
        self._calculate_length()

    def getRandom(self) -> int:
        index = random.randint(0, self._length-1)
        temp = self._head;
        for _ in range(index):
            temp = temp.next
        return temp.val

    def _calculate_length(self):
        temp = self._head
        self._length = 0
        while temp:
            self._length += 1
            temp = temp.next

# Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Solution(head)
# param_1 = obj.getRandom()
```

The given solution uses the Reservoir Sampling algorithm to choose a random node from the linked list. Reservoir Sampling is a technique used to select a random sample of k items from a list of n items, where n is either a very large or unknown number. In this case, we want to select one random node from the linked list.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Initialize the head of the linked list and calculate the length of the list.
2. In the `getRandom()` method, generate a random index between 0 and `length-1`, inclusive, where `length` is the length of the linked list.
3. Traverse the linked list from the head to the node at the generated index and return the value of that node.

By selecting a random index within the range of the list length, each node in the linked list has an equal probability of being chosen.

#### Analysis of Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of the `getRandom()` method is O(n), where n is the length of the linked list. This is because the algorithm traverses the linked list from the head to the randomly selected node.

The space complexity of the solution is O(1) since it only uses a constant amount of extra space to store the head pointer and the length of the list.

#### Summary

The given solution implements a class `Solution` that allows selecting a random node from a singly linked list. It uses the Reservoir Sampling algorithm to achieve equal probability selection. The `getRandom()` method has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making it an efficient solution for the problem at hand.
