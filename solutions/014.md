# [48. Rotate Image](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

You are given an `n x n` 2D `matrix` representing an image, rotate the image by **90** degrees (clockwise).
You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. **DO NOT** allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.


## Examples:

**Example 1:**

![example-01](./resources/14_02_01.jpeg)
```text
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]
```

**Example 2:**

![example-02](./resources/14_02_02.jpeg)
```text
Input: matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]]
Output: [[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]]
```

## Constraints:

- `n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 20`
- `-1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000`


## Solutions

### Simple solution
In order to rotate the matrix clockwise by 90 degrees, we can flip the matrix by its diagonals, and then reverse it. 

1 2 3          1 4 7          7 4 1
4 5 6    =>    2 5 8    =>    8 5 2
7 8 9          3 6 9          9 6 3


#### Python3 

```python3
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
        n = len(matrix)
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]
                
        for i in range(n) :
            for j in range(n//2):
                matrix[i][j], matrix[i][-1-j] = matrix[i][-1-j], matrix[i][j]
```
