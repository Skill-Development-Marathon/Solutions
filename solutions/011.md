# [13. Roman to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/description/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```text
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

```

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two ones added 
together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27`
is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. 
However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is 
written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making 
four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`.
There are six instances where subtraction is used:

`I` can be placed before `V` (`5`) and `X` (`10`) to make `4` and `9`. 
`X` can be placed before `L` (`50`) and `C` (`100`) to make `40` and `90`. 
`C` can be placed before `D` (`500`) and `M` (`1000`) to make `400` and `900`.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.

```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 15`
- `s` contains only the characters `('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M')`.
- It is guaranteed that `s` is a valid roman numeral in the range `[1, 3999]`.

## Solutions

### Simple solution 

#### Simple solution in Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        single = {
            "M": 1000,
            "D": 500,
            "C": 100,
            "L": 50,
            "X": 10,
            "V": 5,
            "I": 1,
        }
        double = {
            "CM": 900,
            "CD": 400,
            "XC": 90,
            "XL": 40,
            "IX": 9,
            "IV": 4,
        }

        index, number, length = 0, 0, len(s)

        while index < length:
            if index + 1 < length and s[index:index+2] in double:
                number += double[s[index:index+2]]
                index += 2
            else:
                number += single[s[index]]
                index += 1
        return number
            
```

###  Solution in Typescript
```
typescript

enum SymbolsEnum {
    I = "I",
    V = "V",
    X = "X",
    L = "L",
    C = "C",
    D = "D",
    M = "M"
}

const SymbolValues = {
    [SymbolsEnum.I]: 1,
    [SymbolsEnum.V]: 5,
    [SymbolsEnum.X]: 10,
    [SymbolsEnum.L]: 50,
    [SymbolsEnum.C]: 100,
    [SymbolsEnum.D]: 500,
    [SymbolsEnum.M]: 1000,
}

const checkSymbol = (current: SymbolsEnum, next: SymbolsEnum | undefined): number => {
    switch(current) {
        case SymbolsEnum.I: {
            return (next === SymbolsEnum.V || next === SymbolsEnum.X) ? -1 : 1
        }
        case SymbolsEnum.X: {
            return (next === SymbolsEnum.L || next === SymbolsEnum.C) ? -10 : 10
        }
        case SymbolsEnum.C: {
            return (next === SymbolsEnum.D || next === SymbolsEnum.M) ? -100 : 100
        }
        default: {
            return SymbolValues[current]
        }
    }
}

function romanToInt(s: string): number {
    let result = 0;
    for(let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        result += checkSymbol(s[i] as any, s[i+1] as any)
    }
    return result
};

```
