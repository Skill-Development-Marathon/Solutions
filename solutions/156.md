2390. Removing Stars From a String
**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy| :yellow_circle: Medium| :red_circle: Hard

You are given a string s, which contains stars *.

In one operation, you can:

Choose a star in s.
Remove the closest non-star character to its left, as well as remove the star itself.
Return the string after all stars have been removed.

Note:

The input will be generated such that the operation is always possible.
It can be shown that the resulting string will always be unique.

## Examples:

Example 1:

Input: s = "leet**cod*e"
Output: "lecoe"
Explanation: Performing the removals from left to right:
- The closest character to the 1st star is 't' in "leet**cod*e". s becomes "lee*cod*e".
- The closest character to the 2nd star is 'e' in "lee*cod*e". s becomes "lecod*e".
- The closest character to the 3rd star is 'd' in "lecod*e". s becomes "lecoe".
There are no more stars, so we return "lecoe".
Example 2:

Input: s = "erase*****"
Output: ""
Explanation: The entire string is removed, so we return an empty string.

## Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of lowercase English letters and stars *.
The operation above can be performed on s.

## Solutions

EASY & SIMPLE approach for problem solution

```
def removeStars(self, s: str) -> str:
        ans=[]
        for i in s:
            if i=='*':
                ans.pop()
            else:
                ans+=[i]
        return "".join(ans)
