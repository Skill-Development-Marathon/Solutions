# [1773. Count Items Matching a Rule](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-items-matching-a-rule/description/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

You are given an array `items`, where each `items[i] = [typei, colori, namei]` describes the type, color, and name of the `ith` item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings, `ruleKey` and `ruleValue`.

The `ith` item is said to match the rule if **one** of the following is true:

- `ruleKey == "type"` and `ruleValue == typei`.
- `ruleKey == "color"` and `ruleValue == colori`.
- `ruleKey == "name"` and `ruleValue == namei`.

Return *the number of items that match the given rule*.


## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "color", ruleValue = "silver"
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one item matching the given rule, which is ["computer","silver","lenovo"].

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","phone"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "type", ruleValue = "phone"
Output: 2
Explanation: There are only two items matching the given rule, which are ["phone","blue","pixel"] and ["phone","gold","iphone"]. Note that the item ["computer","silver","phone"] does not match.
```


## Constraints:

- `1 <= items.length <= 104`
- `1 <= typei.length, colori.length, namei.length, ruleValue.length <= 10`
- `ruleKey` is equal to either `"type"`, `"color"`, or `"name"`.
- All strings consist only of lowercase letters.


## Solutions

### O(n) solution

The algorithm aims to count the number of items that match a given rule. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the algorithm's time and space complexity:

1. **Initialization**: The algorithm initializes a variable `count` to 0. This operation takes constant time.
2. **Counting Matches**: The algorithm iterates over each `item` in the `items` list using a for loop. For each item, it checks if the `ruleKey` matches one of the predefined keys ("type", "color", "name"). If there is a match, it compares the corresponding value (type_, color, or name) with the given `ruleValue`. If the values match, it increments the `count` by 1.
3. **Returning Count**: Finally, the algorithm returns the value of `count`, which requires constant time.

The time complexity of the algorithm depends on the size of the `items` list. In the worst case, it needs to iterate through each item, resulting in a linear time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of items in the list. However, if a match is found early in the list, the algorithm may terminate sooner.
In terms of space complexity, the algorithm only uses a constant amount of extra space for the `count` variable. Hence, the space complexity is O(1).

To summarize:
- Time complexity: O(n) - Linear time complexity, where n is the number of items in the list.
- Space complexity: O(1) - Constant space complexity.

The algorithm's performance is efficient for processing lists of moderate size since it iterates through each item in the list once. It doesn't rely on additional data structures or complex operations, making it straightforward and effective for counting matches based on different rule keys.

#### Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def countMatches(self, items: List[List[str]], ruleKey: str, ruleValue: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        for type_, color, name in items:
            if ruleKey == "type" and type_ == ruleValue:
                count += 1
            elif ruleKey == "color" and color == ruleValue:
                count += 1
            elif ruleKey == "name" and name == ruleValue:
                count += 1
        return count
```

#### PHP
```php
class Solution {

    /**
     * @param String[][] $items
     * @param String $ruleKey
     * @param String $ruleValue
     * @return Integer
     */
    function countMatches($items, $ruleKey, $ruleValue) {
        $result = 0;
        foreach($items as $item){
            $result += match ($ruleKey) {
                'type' => intval($item[0] == $ruleValue),
                'color' => intval($item[1] == $ruleValue),
                'name' => intval($item[2] == $ruleValue),
            };
        }
        return $result;
    }
}
```
