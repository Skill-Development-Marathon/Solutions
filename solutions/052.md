# [1721. Swapping Nodes in a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/swapping-nodes-in-a-linked-list/)

**Difficulty:** 🟡 Medium

You are given the `head` of a linked list, and an integer `k`.
Return *the head of the linked list after **swapping** the values of the* `kth` *node from the beginning and the* `kth` *node from the end (the list is **1-indexed**).*

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

![052_01.jpg](./resources/052_01.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [1,4,3,2,5]

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [7,9,6,6,7,8,3,0,9,5], k = 5
Output: [7,9,6,6,8,7,3,0,9,5]

```

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
- `1 <= k <= n <= 105`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 100`


## Solutions

### O(n) solution

```python3
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def swapNodes(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        pointer = head
        for _ in range(k-1):
            pointer = pointer.next

        left_node = pointer
        right_node = head

        while pointer.next:
            pointer = pointer.next
            right_node = right_node.next

        left_node.val, right_node.val = right_node.val, left_node.val

        return head
```

The given solution approach swaps the values of the `k`-th node from the beginning and the `k`-th node from the end in a linked list. It follows these steps:

1. Traverse the linked list to find the `k`-th node from the beginning and store it in `left_node`.
2. Initialize two pointers, `left_node` and `right_node`, both pointing to the head of the linked list.
3. Move the `right_node` pointer to the `(n - k)`-th node from the beginning, where `n` is the length of the linked list.
4. Swap the values of `left_node.val` and `right_node.val`.
5. Return the head of the modified linked list.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n) since it requires traversing the linked list twice: once to find the `k`-th node from the beginning and once to find the `(n - k)`-th node from the beginning.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1) since it uses a constant amount of additional space.

#### Summary

The given solution swaps the values of the `k`-th node from the beginning and the `k`-th node from the end in a linked list. It traverses the linked list twice, swaps the values, and returns the head of the modified linked list. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).
