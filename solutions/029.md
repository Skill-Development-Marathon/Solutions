# [2114. Maximum Number of Words Found in Sentences](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-words-found-in-sentences/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

A **sentence** is a list of **words** that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.

You are given an array of strings `sentences`, where each `sentences[i]` represents a single **sentence**.

Return *the **maximum number of words** that appear in a single sentence*.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: sentences = ["alice and bob love leetcode", "i think so too","this is great thanks very much"]
Output: 6
Explanation:
- The first sentence, "alice and bob love leetcode", has 5 words in total.
- The second sentence, "i think so too", has 4 words in total.
- The third sentence, "this is great thanks very much", has 6 words in total.
Thus, the maximum number of words in a single sentence comes from the third sentence, which has 6 words.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: sentences = ["please wait","continue to fight","continue to win"]
Output: 3
Explanation: It is possible that multiple sentences contain the same number of words.
In this example, the second and third sentences (underlined) have the same number of words.

```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= sentences.length <= 100`
- `1 <= sentences[i].length <= 100`
- `sentences[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters and `' '` only.
- `sentences[i]` does not have leading or trailing spaces.
- All the words in `sentences[i]` are separated by a single space.

## Solutions

### O(nxm) solution

The given algorithm takes a list of sentences as input and returns the maximum number of words found in any single sentence.

1. The algorithm defines a class `Solution` with a method `mostWordsFound` that takes `sentences` as a parameter and returns an integer.
2. Inside the `mostWordsFound` method, the algorithm uses a list comprehension to iterate over each `sentence` in the `sentences` list.
3. Within the list comprehension, the algorithm splits each `sentence` into words using the space character as the delimiter. It uses the `split(" ")` method to perform this splitting.
4. The algorithm calculates the length of each split sentence, representing the number of words in that sentence.
5. The list comprehension generates a list of these word counts for each sentence.
6. The algorithm then uses the `max()` function to find the maximum value from the list of word counts.
7. Finally, the algorithm returns the maximum number of words found in any single sentence.

**Complexity Analysis**

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n \* m), where n is the number of sentences in the input list `sentences` and m is the average number of words in each sentence. This is because the algorithm iterates over each sentence and performs the `split()` operation, which takes time proportional to the number of words in each sentence.
The space complexity is O(1) because the algorithm does not use any additional data structures that grow with the input size. It only stores the intermediate values of the word counts, which do not depend on the input size.

#### Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def mostWordsFound(self, sentences: List[str]) -> int:
        return max(len(sentence.split(" ")) for sentence in sentences)
```

#### TypeScript

```typescript
function mostWordsFound(sentences: string[]): number {
  let maxNum: number = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < sentences.length; i++) {
    let countOfWords = sentences[i].split(' ').length;

    if (maxNum < countOfWords) {
      maxNum = countOfWords;
    }
  }

  return maxNum;
}
```
