# [890. Find and Replace Pattern](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-and-replace-pattern/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

Given a list of strings `words` and a string `pattern`, return *a list of* `words[i]` *that match* `pattern`. You may return the answer in **any order**.
A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters `p` so that after replacing every letter `x` in the pattern with `p(x)`, we get the desired word.
Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"], pattern = "abb"
Output: ["mee","aqq"]
Explanation: "mee" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a -> m, b -> e, ...}.
"ccc" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a permutation, since a and b map to the same letter.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["a","b","c"], pattern = "a"
Output: ["a","b","c"]
```


## Constraints:

- `1 <= pattern.length <= 20`
- `1 <= words.length <= 50`
- `words[i].length == pattern.length`
- `pattern` and `words[i]` are lowercase English letters.

    def findAndReplacePattern(self, words: List[str], pattern: str) -> List[str]:
        def is_match(word, pattern):
            word_to_pattern = {}
            pattern_to_word = {}
            for char_word, char_pattern in zip(word, pattern):
                if char_word not in word_to_pattern and char_pattern not in pattern_to_word:
                    word_to_pattern[char_word] = char_pattern
                    pattern_to_word[char_pattern] = char_word
                if (char_word in word_to_pattern and word_to_pattern[char_word] != char_pattern) or \
                   (char_pattern in pattern_to_word and pattern_to_word[char_pattern] != char_word):
                    return False
            return True

        answer = []
        for word in words:
            if is_match(word, pattern):
                answer.append(word)
        return answer
```

The solution involves checking each word in the `words` list to determine if it matches the given pattern. To do this, we'll define a helper function, `is_match(word, pattern)`, that checks if a given `word` matches the `pattern`.

Here's how the solution works:

1. Define the `is_match(word, pattern)` function that takes a word and a pattern as input. Within this function, initialize two dictionaries, `word_to_pattern` and `pattern_to_word`, which will store the mapping of characters from the word to the pattern and vice versa.
2. Iterate through each character pair, `(char_word, char_pattern)`, where `char_word` is a character from the word and `char_pattern` is a character from the pattern. For each character pair, perform the following steps:
   - If `char_word` is not in the `word_to_pattern` dictionary and `char_pattern` is not in the `pattern_to_word` dictionary, this means that the mapping of `char_word` to `char_pattern` and `char_pattern` to `char_word` has not been established yet. In this case, add `char_word` to `word_to_pattern` with a value of `char_pattern` and add `char_pattern` to `pattern_to_word` with a value of `char_word`.
   - If `char_word` is already in the `word_to_pattern` dictionary, check if the value associated with `char_word` is equal to `char_pattern`. If they are not equal, return `False` because the mapping is not consistent.
   - If `char_pattern` is already in the `pattern_to_word` dictionary, check if the value associated with `char_pattern` is equal to `char_word`. If they are not equal, return `False` because the mapping is not consistent.
3. After iterating through all character pairs, if no inconsistencies are found in the mappings, return `True` from the `is_match` function, indicating that the word matches the pattern.
4. In the main part of the solution, initialize an empty list `answer` to store the words that match the pattern.
5. Iterate through each word in the `words` list. For each word, call the `is_match` function with the word and the pattern as arguments. If the function returns `True`, append the word to the `answer` list.
6. After iterating through all words, the `answer` list contains the words that match the pattern. Return the `answer` list as the final result.

#### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: The solution iterates through the `words` list once and performs checks for each character pair in the word and pattern, leading to a time complexity of O(n * m), where n is the number of words and m is the length of the pattern.
- Space Complexity: The solution uses additional space to store the dictionaries `word_to_pattern` and `pattern_to_word`, which can have a maximum of 26 lowercase letters as keys and values. Therefore, the space complexity is O(26) ≈ O(1), as it is a constant amount of space.

#### Summary

The provided solution effectively checks each word in the `words` list to determine if it matches the given `pattern` by establishing mappings between characters. It has a time complexity of O(n * m) and a space complexity of O(1), making it efficient for the given constraints.
