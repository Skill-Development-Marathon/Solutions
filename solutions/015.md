# [2652. Sum Multiples](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-multiples/description/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

Given a positive integer `n`, find the sum of all integers in the range `[1, n]` inclusive that are divisible by `3`, `5`, or `7`.
Return an integer denoting the sum of all numbers in the given range satisfying the constraint.


## Examples:
 
**Example 1:**
```text
Input: n = 7
Output: 21
Explanation: Numbers in the range [1, 7] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7 are 3, 5, 6, 7. The sum of these numbers is 21.
```

**Example 2:**
```text
Input: n = 10
Output: 40
Explanation: Numbers in the range [1, 10] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7 are 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10. The sum of these numbers is 40.
```

**Example 3:**
```text
Input: n = 9
Output: 30
Explanation: Numbers in the range [1, 9] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7 are 3, 5, 6, 7, 9. The sum of these numbers is 30.
```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= n <= 103`


## Solutions

### Simple O(n) 

#### Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def sumOfMultiples(self, n: int) -> int:
        total = 0
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0 or i % 7 == 0:
                total += i
        return total
                
```
### Solution in Typescript

```typescript

function sumOfMultiples(n: number): number {
    let sum = 0;
    for(let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        if((i % 3 === 0) || (i % 5 === 0) || (i % 7 === 0)) {
            sum += i;
        }
    }
    return sum;
}

```
