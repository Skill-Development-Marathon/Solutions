# [1769. Minimum Number of Operations to Move All Balls to Each Box](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-move-all-balls-to-each-box/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

You have `n` boxes. You are given a binary string `boxes` of length `n`, where 
`boxes[i]` is `'0'` if the i<sup>th</sup> box is empty, and `'1'` if it 
contains one ball.

In one operation, you can move **one** ball from a box to an adjacent box. Box
`i` is adjacent to box `j` if `abs(i - j) == 1`. Note that after doing so, 
there may be more than one ball in some boxes.

Return an array `answer` of size `n`, where `answer[i]` is the **minimum** 
number of operations needed to move all the balls to the i<sup>th</sup> box.

Each `answer[i]` is calculated considering the **initial** state of the boxes.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: boxes = "110"
Output: [1,1,3]
Explanation: The answer for each box is as follows:
1) First box: you will have to move one ball from the second box to the first box in one operation.
2) Second box: you will have to move one ball from the first box to the second box in one operation.
3) Third box: you will have to move one ball from the first box to the third box in two operations, and move one ball from the second box to the third box in one operation.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: boxes = "001011"
Output: [11,8,5,4,3,4]
```

## Constraints:

- `n == boxes.length` 
- `1 <= n <= 2000` 
- `boxes[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.


## Solutions

### Naive approach

The given algorithm takes a string `boxes` as input and returns a list of 
integers representing the minimum number of operations required to move all 
the balls to each box.

1. The algorithm defines a class `Solution` with a method `minOperations` 
that takes `boxes` as a parameter and returns a list of integers.
2. Inside the `minOperations` method, the algorithm first calculates the 
length of the input string `boxes` and stores it in the variable `length`.
3. It initializes an empty list `result` that will store the minimum operation 
counts for each box.
4. The algorithm then starts a loop from 0 to `length - 1` to iterate over 
each box.
5. Within the loop, it initializes a variable `count` to 0, which will keep 
track of the minimum operation count for the current box.
6. Another nested loop is used to iterate over each box again, denoted by the 
variable `j`, to calculate the operation count for the current `i` and `j` 
indices.
7. If the current indices `i` and `j` are the same (i.e., the same box), the 
algorithm skips the iteration using the `continue` statement.
8. If the current box at index `j` contains a ball (represented by the 
character "1"), the algorithm increments `count` by the absolute difference 
between `j` and `i` multiplied by 1. Otherwise, it multiplies the difference 
by 0 since no operation is needed.
9. After calculating the operation count for the current box, the 
algorithm appends the `count` value to the `result` list.
10. Once the outer loop finishes iterating over all the boxes, 
the algorithm returns the `result` list containing the minimum operation 
counts for each box.

**Complexity Analysis**

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the length of the 
input string `boxes`. This is because the algorithm uses nested loops to 
iterate over each box multiple times, resulting in a quadratic time complexity.
The space complexity is O(n), as the algorithm stores the minimum operation 
counts for each box in the `result` list, which can have a size equal to the 
length of the input string `boxes`.

#### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, boxes: str) -> List[int]:
        length = len(boxes)
        result = []
        for i in range(length):
            count = 0
            for j in range(length):
                if i == j:
                    continue
                count += abs(j-i) * (1 if boxes[j] == "1" else 0)
            result.append(count)
        return result
```
