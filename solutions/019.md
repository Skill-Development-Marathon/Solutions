# [2011. Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations](https://leetcode.com/problems/final-value-of-variable-after-performing-operations/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

There is a programming language with only **four** operations and **one** variable `X`:

- `++X` and `X++` increments the value of the variable `X` by `1`.
- `--X` and `X--` decrements the value of the variable `X` by `1`.

Initially, the value of `X` is `0`.

Given an array of strings `operations` containing a list of operations, return 
the **final** value of `X` after performing all the operations.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
--X: X is decremented by 1, X =  0 - 1 = -1.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = -1 + 1 =  0.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X =  0 + 1 =  1.
```

**Example 2:**
```text
Input: operations = ["++X","++X","X++"]
Output: 3
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 2 + 1 = 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: operations = ["X++","++X","--X","X--"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
--X: X is decremented by 1, X = 2 - 1 = 1.
X--: X is decremented by 1, X = 1 - 1 = 0.
```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= operations.length <= 100` 
- `operations[i]` will be either `"++X"`, `"X++"`, `"--X"`, or `"X--"`.


## Solutions


### O(n) solution

Iterate over the given operations array and increment or decrement `total`.

#### Python3 

```python3
class Solution:
    def finalValueAfterOperations(self, operations: List[str]) -> int:
        total = 0
        for operation in operations:
            if operation == "--X" or operation == "X--":
                total -= 1
            else:
                total += 1
        return total
```
#### TypeScript

``` typescript
function finalValueAfterOperations(operations: string[]): number {
    let res = 0
    for(let operation of operations){
        operation[1] === '+' ? res++ : res--
    }
    return res;
};
```
