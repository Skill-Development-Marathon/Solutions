# [2011. Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations](https://leetcode.com/problems/final-value-of-variable-after-performing-operations/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

There is a programming language with only **four** operations and **one** variable `X`:

- `++X` and `X++` increments the value of the variable `X` by `1`.
- `--X` and `X--` decrements the value of the variable `X` by `1`.

Initially, the value of `X` is `0`.

Given an array of strings `operations` containing a list of operations, return 
the **final** value of `X` after performing all the operations.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
--X: X is decremented by 1, X =  0 - 1 = -1.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = -1 + 1 =  0.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X =  0 + 1 =  1.
```

**Example 2:**
```text
Input: operations = ["++X","++X","X++"]
Output: 3
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 2 + 1 = 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: operations = ["X++","++X","--X","X--"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
--X: X is decremented by 1, X = 2 - 1 = 1.
X--: X is decremented by 1, X = 1 - 1 = 0.
```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= operations.length <= 100` 
- `operations[i]` will be either `"++X"`, `"X++"`, `"--X"`, or `"X--"`.


## Solutions


### O(n) solution in Python3 

```python3
class Solution:
    def finalValueAfterOperations(self, operations: List[str]) -> int:
        total = 0
        for operation in operations:
            if operation == "--X" or operation == "X--":
                total -= 1
            else:
                total += 1
        return total
```

The given solution solves the problem by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a variable `total` to store the current value of `X`.
2. Iterate through each operation in the `operations` array.
3. For each operation, check its value:
   - If the operation is `"--X"` or `"X--"`, decrement the value of `total` by 1.
   - Otherwise, increment the value of `total` by 1.
4. After performing all the operations, the final value of `X` is stored in the `total` variable.
5. Return the value of `total` as the final answer.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the `operations` array. This is because the algorithm performs a single pass through the array to evaluate each operation.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1) since it only uses a constant amount of memory to store the `total` variable. The memory usage does not depend on the input size.

#### Summary

The given solution effectively evaluates the final value of `X` after performing a series of operations. It iterates through the `operations` array, incrementing or decrementing the `total` variable based on the operation type. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making it an efficient solution for the problem.

    public int finalValueAfterOperations(String[] operations) {
        int result = 0;
        var operator = new HashMap<String, Integer>();
        operator.put("X++",1);
        operator.put("X--",-1);
        operator.put("++X",1);
        operator.put("--X",-1);
        for(String num: operations){
            result += operator.get(num);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
