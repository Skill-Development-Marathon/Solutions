# [1528. Shuffle String](https://leetcode.com/problems/shuffle-string/description/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

You are given a string `s` and an integer array `indices` of the 
**same length**. The string `s` will be shuffled such that the character at 
the `ith` position moves to `indices[i]` in the shuffled string.

Return *the shuffled string*.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

![image](./resources/33_01.jpeg)

```
Input: s = "codeleet",indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abc",indices = [0,1,2]
Output: "abc"
Explanation: After shuffling, each character remains in its position.

```

## Constraints:

- `s.length == indices.length == n`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
- `0 <= indices[i] < n`
- All values of `indices` are **unique**.


## Solutions

### O(n) solution

The algorithm aims to restore a shuffled string based on the given indices. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the algorithm's time and space complexity:

1. **Initialization**: The algorithm initializes a dictionary called `mapping` using the `zip` function to combine the `indices` list and the characters from the input string `s`. This operation takes O(n) time, where n is the length of the string.
2. **String Reconstruction**: The algorithm uses a list comprehension and the `mapping` dictionary to reconstruct the original string. It iterates over the range of the length of the string (n) and retrieves the corresponding character from the `mapping` dictionary using each index. This operation is performed n times, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).
3. **Joining Characters**: Finally, the algorithm uses the `"".join()` function to concatenate the characters obtained in the previous step into a single string. This operation also takes O(n) time since it concatenates n characters.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(n).

In terms of space complexity, the algorithm utilizes additional memory to store the `mapping` dictionary, which has a maximum size of n. Thus, the space complexity is O(n).

To summarize:
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(n)

The algorithm has a linear time complexity, meaning the execution time grows linearly with the size of the input. It is efficient for processing strings of moderate lengths. However, if the input size increases significantly, the algorithm's performance may be impacted.

#### Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def restoreString(self, s: str, indices: List[int]) -> str:
        mapping = dict(zip(indices, s))
        return "".join([mapping[index] for index in range(len(s))])
```

#### PHP
```php
class Solution {

    /**
     * @param String $s
     * @param Integer[] $indices
     * @return String
     */
    function restoreString($s, $indices) {
        $n = count($indices);
        $mapping = $indices;
        
        for($i = 0; $i < $n; $i++){
            $mapping[$indices[$i]] = $s[$i];
        }
        return implode('', $mapping);
    }
}
```
