# [1528. Shuffle String](https://leetcode.com/problems/shuffle-string/description/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

You are given a string `s` and an integer array `indices` of the 
**same length**. The string `s` will be shuffled such that the character at 
the `ith` position moves to `indices[i]` in the shuffled string.

Return *the shuffled string*.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

![image](./resources/33_01.jpeg)

```
Input: s = "codeleet",indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abc",indices = [0,1,2]
Output: "abc"
Explanation: After shuffling, each character remains in its position.

```

## Constraints:

- `s.length == indices.length == n`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
- `0 <= indices[i] < n`
- All values of `indices` are **unique**.


## Solutions

### O(n) solution in Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def restoreString(self, s: str, indices: List[int]) -> str:
        mapping = dict(zip(indices, s))
        return "".join([mapping[index] for index in range(len(s))])
```

The given solution shuffles the string `s` based on the given `indices` array by creating a mapping between the indices and the corresponding characters in the original string. It then uses this mapping to generate the shuffled string.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Create an empty dictionary, `mapping`, to store the mapping between indices and characters.
2. Iterate through the `indices` array and the characters of the original string `s` simultaneously:
   - Add a key-value pair to the `mapping` dictionary, where the index is the key and the character is the value.
3. Create an empty string, `shuffled`, to store the shuffled string.
4. Iterate through the range from 0 to the length of `s`:
   - Append the character from the `mapping` dictionary at the corresponding index to the `shuffled` string.
5. Return the `shuffled` string, which represents the shuffled version of the original string.

The algorithm creates a mapping between the indices and characters, and then constructs the shuffled string by retrieving the characters from the mapping based on the indices.

#### Analysis of Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s` and the `indices` array. The algorithm iterates through the `indices` array and the characters of `s` once, performing constant-time operations at each iteration.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n) as it uses additional space to store the `mapping` dictionary and the `shuffled` string, each with a maximum size of n.

#### Summary

The given solution shuffles the string `s` based on the given `indices` array by creating a mapping between the indices and characters and then constructing the shuffled string using this mapping. It has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), making it an efficient solution for the problem at hand.
