# [1637. Widest Vertical Area Between Two Points Containing No Points](https://leetcode.com/problems/widest-vertical-area-between-two-points-containing-no-points/description/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

Given `n` `points` on a 2D plane where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`, Return *the **widest vertical area** between two points such that no points are inside the area.*

A **vertical area** is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The **widest vertical area** is the one with the maximum width.

Note that points **on the edge** of a vertical area **are not** considered included in the area.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

![https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/19/points3.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/19/points3.png)

```
Input: points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Both the red and the blue area are optimal.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: points = [[3,1],[9,0],[1,0],[1,4],[5,3],[8,8]]
Output: 3

```

## Constraints:

- `n == points.length`
- `2 <= n <= 105`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= xi, yi <= 109`


## Solutions

### O(n\*log(n)) solution 

The algorithm aims to find the maximum width of a vertical area formed by a set of points. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the algorithm's time and space complexity:

1. **Sorting Points**: The algorithm starts by sorting the given list of points based on their x-coordinate using the `sorted()` function and a lambda function as the key. Sorting the points takes O(n log n) time, where n is the number of points in the list.

2. **Finding Maximum Width**: The algorithm initializes a variable `maximum` to 0. Then, it iterates over the sorted list of points from index 1 to len(points)-1. In each iteration, it calculates the difference between the x-coordinate of the current point and the previous point, and updates the `maximum` value if the difference is larger than the current `maximum`. This loop iterates n-1 times, where n is the number of points in the list. Thus, this step has a time complexity of O(n).

3. **Returning Maximum Width**: Finally, the algorithm returns the value of `maximum`, which requires constant time.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is dominated by the sorting step, resulting in a time complexity of O(n log n).

In terms of space complexity, the algorithm does not utilize any additional data structures that grow with the input size. It only uses a constant amount of extra space for variables. Hence, the space complexity is O(1).

To summarize:
- Time complexity: O(n log n)
- Space complexity: O(1)

The algorithm has a time complexity that grows logarithmically with the number of points. It is efficient for processing a moderate number of points, but as the number of points increases significantly, the sorting step becomes more time-consuming.

#### Python3
```python3
class Solution:
    def maxWidthOfVerticalArea(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        points = sorted(points, key=lambda point: point[0])
        maximum = 0
        for i in range(1, len(points)):
            maximum = max(points[i][0]-points[i-1][0], maximum)
        return maximum
```

#### PHP
```php
class Solution {

    /**
     * @param Integer[][] $points
     * @return Integer
     */
    function maxWidthOfVerticalArea($points) {
        usort($points, function($a, $b){
            return $a[0] > $b[0] ? 1 : -1;
        });

        $max = 0;
        $n = count($points);
        for($i = 0; $i < $n - 1; $i++){
            $max = max($max, $points[$i + 1][0] - $points[$i][0]);
        }

        return $max;
    }
}
```
