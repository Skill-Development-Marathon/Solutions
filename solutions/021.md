# [1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies](https://leetcode.com/problems/kids-with-the-greatest-number-of-candies/description/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

There are `n` kids with candies. You are given an integer array `candies`,
where each `candies[i]` represents the number of candies the i<sup>th</sub> 
kid has, and an integer `extraCandies`, denoting the number of extra candies 
that you have.

Return a boolean array `result` of length n, where `result[i]` is `true` if, 
after giving the i<sup>th</sup> kid all the `extraCandies`, they will have 
the **greatest** number of candies among all the kids, or `false` otherwise.

Note that **multiple** kids can have the **greatest** number of candies.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true] 
Explanation: If you give all extraCandies to:
- Kid 1, they will have 2 + 3 = 5 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 2, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 3, they will have 5 + 3 = 8 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 4, they will have 1 + 3 = 4 candies, which is not the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 5, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: candies = [4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1
Output: [true,false,false,false,false] 
Explanation: There is only 1 extra candy.
Kid 1 will always have the greatest number of candies, even if a different kid is given the extra candy.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: candies = [12,1,12], extraCandies = 10
Output: [true,false,true]
```

## Constraints:

- `n == candies.length`
- `2 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= candies[i] <= 100`
- `1 <= extraCandies <= 50`


## Solutions

### O(n) solution

The algorithm works as follows:

1. It first finds the maximum number of candies present in the `candies` list by using the `max` function and assigns it to the variable `greatest`.
2. Next, it uses a list comprehension to iterate over each candy count in the `candies` list. For each candy count, it checks if adding `extraCandies` to the current count would make it greater than or equal to the `greatest` count. If it is, it appends `True` to the resulting list; otherwise, it appends `False`.
3. Finally, it returns the resulting list of boolean values indicating whether each kid can have the greatest number of candies when `extraCandies` are added or not.

The algorithm essentially determines if each kid can have the maximum number of candies after adding the extra candies, by comparing their candy count with the greatest count in the list.

#### Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def kidsWithCandies(self, candies: List[int], extraCandies: int) -> List[bool]:
        greatest = max(candies)
        return [extraCandies+candy >= greatest for candy in candies]
```
#### TypeScript

``` typescript
function kidsWithCandies(candies: number[], extraCandies: number): boolean[] {
    return candies.map(candy => isGreaterAll(candies, candy + extraCandies));
};

function isGreaterAll(array: number[], value: number): boolean {
    return array.every(item => item <= value)
}  
```
