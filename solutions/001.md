# [2413. Smallest Even Multiple](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-even-multiple/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

Given a positive integer n, return the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 2 and n.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: n = 5
Output: 10
Explanation: The smallest multiple of both 5 and 2 is 10.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: The smallest multiple of both 6 and 2 is 6. Note that a number is a multiple of itself.
```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= n <= 150`

## Solutions
First, we check whether the given number is devisable by 2 if so we return the same number. 
Otherwise, we multiply the given number by 2 in order to make it a multiple of 2.

### O(1) solution

#### Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def smallestEvenMultiple(self, n: int) -> int:
        return n * 2 if n % 2 else n
```
#### JavaScript

```js
const smallestEvenMultiple = n => n % 2 === 0 ? n : n * 2
```

#### TypeScript

```typescript
function smallestEvenMultiple(n: number): number {
  if (n % 2 === 0) return n;

  return n * 2;
}
```

#### Php

```php
class Solution {

    /**
     * @param Integer $n
     * @return Integer
     */
    function smallestEvenMultiple($n) {
        while ($n % 2 != 0)
            return $n * 2;
        
        return $n;
        
    }
}
```

The given solution solves the problem by checking if `n` is divisible by 2. If `n` is divisible by 2, it means that `n` itself is the smallest multiple of both 2 and `n`. In this case, the solution returns `n`. Otherwise, if `n` is not divisible by 2, the solution returns `n * 2`, which is the smallest even multiple of `n`.

The algorithm follows these steps:
1. Check if `n` is divisible by 2 (i.e., `n % 2 == 0`).
2. If `n` is divisible by 2, return `n` as it is the smallest multiple of both 2 and `n`.
3. If `n` is not divisible by 2, return `n * 2` as it is the smallest even multiple of `n`.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(1) because it performs a constant number of operations, regardless of the value of `n`.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of space to store the intermediate results.

#### Summary

The given solution finds the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 2 and the given positive integer `n`. It checks if `n` is divisible by 2 and returns `n` if it is divisible by 2. Otherwise, it returns `n * 2`, which is the smallest even multiple of `n`. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(1) and a space complexity of O(1).
