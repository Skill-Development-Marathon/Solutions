# [1108. Defanging an IP Address](https://leetcode.com/problems/defanging-an-ip-address/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

Given a valid (IPv4) IP `address`, return a defanged version of that IP address.

A defanged IP address replaces every period `"."` with `"[.]"`.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**
```text
Input: address = "1.1.1.1"
Output: "1[.]1[.]1[.]1"
```

**Example 2:**
```text
Input: address = "255.100.50.0"
Output: "255[.]100[.]50[.]0"
```

## Constraints:

- The given address is a valid IPv4 `address`. 


## Solutions



### Name of solution 

Defanged IP addresses are entries that have been modified in a 
standardized way such as to prevent accidental access. 

# Simple solution in O(1)

In order to defanged IP addresses we need to split the given IP address string by
`.` and replace it with `[.]`.

#### Python3 

```python
class Solution:
    def defangIPaddr(self, address: str) -> str:
        return "[.]".join(address.split("."))
```

#### TypeScript
**Please suggest a better version of this code.** 
```typescript
function defangIPaddr(address: string): string {
    let result = '';
    for(let i = 0; i < address.length; i++) {
        result += address[i] === '.' ? '[.]' : address[i]
    }
    return result;
};
```

#### Java
```java
class Solution {
    public String defangIPaddr(String address) {
       address = address.replace("." , "[.]");
            return address;
    }
}
```
