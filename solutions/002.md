# [2396. Strictly Palindromic Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/strictly-palindromic-number/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

An integer n is strictly palindromic if, for every base b between 2 and n - 2
(inclusive), the string representation of the integer n in base b is palindromic.
Given an integer n, return true if n is strictly palindromic and false otherwise.
A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: n = 9
Output: false
Explanation: In base 2: 9 = 1001 (base 2), which is palindromic.
In base 3: 9 = 100 (base 3), which is not palindromic.
Therefore, 9 is not strictly palindromic so we return false.
Note that in bases 4, 5, 6, and 7, n = 9 is also not palindromic.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: n = 4
Output: false
Explanation: We only consider base 2: 4 = 100 (base 2), which is not palindromic.
Therefore, we return false.
```

## Constraints:

- `4 <= n <= 105`

## Solutions

### O(1) solution
There is no such a number in `4 <= n <= 105` which will be strictly palindromic for every base `2` and `n-2`. Because in `n-2` base any number will be `12` which is not palindrome.

#### Python3

```python
class Solution:
    def isStrictlyPalindromic(self, n: int) -> bool:
        return False
```

#### TypeScript

```typescript
function isStrictlyPalindromic(n: number): boolean {
  return false;
}
```

### Naive approach

#### Python3
```python3
class Solution:
    def isStrictlyPalindromic(self, n: int) -> bool:
        # for every integer between 2 and n-2
        # range end is not inclusive thus n-2+1 = n-1
        for i in range(2, n-1):
            # convert to base 2 and check palindrome or not
            base_2 = f"{i:b}"
            if base_2 != base_2[::-1]:
                return False
        return True
```
#### JavaScript
```javascript
var isStrictlyPalindromic = function(n) {
    base = 2

    while(base<=n-2){
        x=n.toString(base)
        if(x==x.split('').reverse().join('')){
            isStrictPalindrome = true
            base++
        } else {
            return false
        }
    }

    return isStrictPalindrome
};
```
#### Go
```go
    func isStrictlyPalindromic(n int) bool {
        return false 
    }
```
