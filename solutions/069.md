# [94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the postorder traversal of its nodes' values*.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

![069_01.jpg](./solutions/resources/069_01.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [3,2,1]

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]

```

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Follow up:

Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

public class Solution {
    public IList<int> PostorderTraversal(TreeNode root) {
        List<int> result = new List<int>();
        if (root == null)
            return result;
        
        Stack<TreeNode> stack = new Stack<TreeNode>();
        stack.Push(root);
        
        while (stack.Count > 0)
        {
            TreeNode node = stack.Pop();
            result.Add(node.val);
            
            if (node.left != null)
                stack.Push(node.left);
            if (node.right != null)
                stack.Push(node.right);
        }
        
        result.Reverse();
        return result;
    }
}
```

The given solution provides an iterative approach to perform a postorder traversal of a binary tree.

Here is an overview of the solution:

1. The `PostorderTraversal` method takes the root of the binary tree as input and returns a list of integers containing the postorder traversal of the tree nodes.
2. Inside the method, we first create an empty list `result` to store the postorder traversal.
3. We check if the `root` is null. If it is, we return the empty result list, as there are no nodes to traverse.
4. If the `root` is not null, we create a stack of tree nodes named stack. We will use this stack to help us simulate the postorder traversal.
5. We start the iterative process by pushing the `root` node onto the stack.
6. Now, we enter the while loop, which will continue until the `stack` is empty.
7. Inside the loop, we pop the top node from the stack and store it in the variable `node`.
8. We add the value of `node` to the `result` list. Since we want the postorder traversal, we add nodes to the `result` list first as root-right-left.
9. If the `node` has a left child, we push the left child onto the stack. This is done before the right child to maintain the order of root-right-left.
10. Similarly, if the `node` has a right child, we push the right child onto the stack.
11. The loop continues, and we process each node in the stack until there are no more nodes to process.
12. After the loop, the `result` list contains the postorder traversal, but in the order of root-right-left.
13. To get the correct postorder sequence, we reverse the `result` list using the `Reverse()` method. Now, the elements that were added first (root-right-left) become the last ones in the result list, which is the desired postorder order (left-right-root).
14. Finally, we return the `result` list, which contains the postorder traversal of the binary tree.

The solution uses an iterative approach and simulates the recursive process of a postorder traversal using a stack to store nodes.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity for this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We visit each node once during the traversal.

The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree. In the worst case, the height of the binary tree can be O(n) for a skewed tree, resulting in O(n) space complexity. However, for a balanced tree, the height is O(log n), resulting in O(log n) space complexity.

#### Summary

The given solution efficiently performs an postorder traversal of a binary tree using an iterative approach. It uses a stack to simulate the recursive process and stores the postorder traversal values in a list. The solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(h), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree and h is the height of the tree.
