# [1551. Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-array-equal/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

You have an array `arr` of length `n` where `arr[i] = (2 * i) + 1` for all valid values of `i` (i.e., `0 <= i < n`).
In one operation, you can select two indices `x` and `y` where `0 <= x, y < n` and subtract `1` from `arr[x]` and add `1` to `arr[y]` (i.e., perform `arr[x] -=1` and `arr[y] += 1`). The goal is to make all the elements of the array `equal`. It is `guaranteed` that all the elements of the array can be made equal using some operations.
Given an integer `n`, the length of the array, return the minimum number of operations needed to make all the elements of arr equal.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**
```text
Input: n = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: arr = [1, 3, 5]
First operation choose x = 2 and y = 0, this leads arr to be [2, 3, 4]
In the second operation choose x = 2 and y = 0 again, thus arr = [3, 3, 3].

```

**Example 2:**
```text
Input: n = 6
Output: 9
```

## Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 104`

### O(1) solution

#### Solution in Python3
```python3
class Solution(object):
    def minOperations(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        return n * n // 4
```

### Solution in TypeScript

```
typescript

function minOperations(n: number): number {
    let sum = 0;
    for(let i = n % 2 + 1; i <= n - 1; i += 2) {
        sum += i;
    }
    return sum
};

 ```
