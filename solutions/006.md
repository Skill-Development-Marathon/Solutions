# [2442. Count Number of Distinct Integers After Reverse Operations](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-distinct-integers-after-reverse-operations/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

You are given an array `nums` consisting of **positive** integers.

You have to take each integer in the array, **reverse its digits**, and add it to the end of the array. You should apply this operation to the original integers in `nums`.

Return the number of **distinct** integers in the final array.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**
```text
Input: nums = [1,13,10,12,31]
Output: 6
Explanation: After including the reverse of each number, the resulting array is [1,13,10,12,31,1,31,1,21,13].
The reversed integers that were added to the end of the array are underlined. Note that for the integer 10, after reversing it, it becomes 01 which is just 1.
The number of distinct integers in this array is 6 (The numbers 1, 10, 12, 13, 21, and 31).
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [2,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: After including the reverse of each number, the resulting array is [2,2,2,2,2,2].
The number of distinct integers in this array is 1 (The number 2).
```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`


## Solutions

### Simple solution 

#### Solution in Python3

```python
class Solution:
    def countDistinctIntegers(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        def reverse(number):
            result = 0
            while number:
                result = result * 10 + number % 10
                number //= 10
            return result

        for num in nums[:]:
            nums.append(reverse(num))
            
        return len(set(nums))
```

#### PHP

```
class Solution {

    /**
     * @param Integer[] $nums
     * @return Integer
     */
    function countDistinctIntegers($nums) {
        $n = count($nums);
        for($i = 0; $i < $n; $i++){
            $nums[] = (int)strrev($nums[$i]);
        }

        return count(array_unique($nums));
    }
}
```
