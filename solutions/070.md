public class Solution

    private void DFS(TreeNode node, int level)
    {
        if (node == null)
            return;

        if (level > deepestLevel)
        {
            deepestSum = node.val;
            deepestLevel = level;
        }
        else if (level == deepestLevel)
        {
            deepestSum += node.val;
        }

        DFS(node.left, level + 1);
        DFS(node.right, level + 1);
    }
}
```

Here is an overview of the solution:

1. The `Solution` class contains two private variables `deepestSum` and `deepestLevel` to keep track of the sum of values at the deepest level and the corresponding level during the `DFS` traversal. The `DeepestLeavesSum` method is the entry point of the solution, which initializes the `deepestSum` and `deepestLevel` to zero and minus one, respectively. It then calls the DFS helper function to traverse the binary tree and find the sum of values at the deepest level.
2. The `DFS` function is a recursive depth-first search that visits each node of the binary tree. It takes two parameters: `node` is the current node being visited, and `level` is the current depth level of the node in the tree.
   During the DFS traversal, the function checks if the current `level` is greater than the `deepestLevel`. If it is, that means we have reached a new deepest level in the tree. In this case, we update `deepestSum` to the value of the current node (`node.val`) and update `deepestLevel` to the current depth level (level). This way, we keep track of the sum of values at the deepest level and its corresponding level.
   If the current `level` is equal to the `deepestLevel`, that means we have found another node at the same deepest level. In this case, we add the value of the current node (`node.val`) to the `deepestSum`.
   After updating the deepestSum and deepestLevel, the function continues the DFS traversal by calling itself recursively on the left and right children of the current node.
3. Once the DFS traversal is completed, the `deepestSum` will contain the sum of values at the deepest level in the binary tree. The `DeepestLeavesSum` method returns this value as the final result.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the solution is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. The reason behind this is that the algorithm performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal, visiting each node once. For every node, we perform constant-time operations (comparisons and updates) to track the deepest level and sum of values at the deepest level. As a result, the overall time complexity is linear, O(N).

The space complexity of the solution is O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree. In the worst case, the binary tree can be skewed (essentially a linked list), and the height becomes equal to the number of nodes, i.e., H = N. In this case, the maximum number of recursive calls on the call stack would be N, leading to O(N) space complexity due to recursion. However, in a balanced binary tree, the height is log(N) (base 2), where N is the number of nodes. In this scenario, the maximum number of recursive calls on the call stack would be log(N), resulting in O(log N) space complexity due to recursion.

#### Summary

The solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to find the sum of values of the deepest leaves in a binary tree. The space complexity of the solution is O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree, and the time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
