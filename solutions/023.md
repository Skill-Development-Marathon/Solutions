# [1672. Richest Customer Wealth](https://leetcode.com/problems/richest-customer-wealth/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

You are given an `m x n` integer grid accounts where `accounts[i][j]` is the 
amount of money the i<sup>th</sup> customer has in the j<sup>th</sup> bank. 
Return the **wealth** that the richest customer has.

A customer's **wealth** is the amount of money they have in all their bank 
accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum **wealth**.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation:
1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
Output: 10
Explanation: 
1st customer has wealth = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 10 
3rd customer has wealth = 8
The 2nd customer is the richest with a wealth of 10.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: accounts = [[2,8,7],[7,1,3],[1,9,5]]
Output: 17
```

## Constraints:

- `m == accounts.length`
- `n == accounts[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 50`
- `1 <= accounts[i][j] <= 100`

## Solutions

### O(mxn) solution

To calculate the total sum of accounts for a user, we iterate over each 
account and add up their values using sum function. After iterating through 
all the accounts, we determine the maximum sum among them using max function.

#### Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def maximumWealth(self, accounts: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        return max(sum(account) for account in accounts) 
```

#### TypeScript

``` typescript
function maximumWealth(accounts: number[][]): number {
    let wealthes = accounts.map(account => account.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0))
    return Math.max(...wealthes);
};
```
