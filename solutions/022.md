# [2610. Convert an Array Into a 2D Array With Conditions](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-an-array-into-a-2d-array-with-conditions/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

You are given an integer array `nums`. You need to create a 2D array from `nums`
satisfying the following conditions:

- The 2D array should contain **only** the elements of the array `nums`.
- Each row in the 2D array contains **distinct** integers.
- The number of rows in the 2D array should be **minimal**.

Return the __resulting array__. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

**Note** that the 2D array can have a different number of elements on each row.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [1,3,4,1,2,3,1]
Output: [[1,3,4,2],[1,3],[1]]
Explanation: We can create a 2D array that contains the following rows:
- 1,3,4,2
- 1,3
- 1
All elements of nums were used, and each row of the 2D array contains distinct integers, so it is a valid answer.
It can be shown that we cannot have less than 3 rows in a valid array.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [[4,3,2,1]]
Explanation: All elements of the array are distinct, so we can keep all of them in the first row of the 2D array.
```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 200`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= nums.length`


## Solutions

### Simple solution

The algorithm works as follows:

1. It first creates a `Counter` object `counter` using the `nums` list. The `Counter` object counts the occurrences of each element in `nums` and stores them as key-value pairs.
2. It initializes an empty list called `result`, which will store the final matrix.
3. It starts a loop that iterates `max(counter.values())` times. This loop is responsible for constructing each row of the matrix.
4. Inside the loop, it creates an empty list called `array` to represent a row of the matrix.
5. It iterates over the keys of the `counter` object using the `counter.keys()` method. This loop is responsible for selecting the elements for each row.
6. For each key (element) `num` in the `counter` object, it checks if the count `counter[num]` is greater than zero. If it is, it appends the `num` to the `array` list, indicating that it belongs to the current row. It also subtracts 1 from the count of `num` in the `counter` object.
7. After constructing a row (`array`), it appends it to the `result` list.
8. Once the loop is finished, it returns the `result` list, which represents the matrix.

In summary, the algorithm uses a `Counter` object to count the occurrences of elements in the `nums` list. It then constructs a matrix by iteratively selecting elements from the `counter` object and forming rows based on their counts. The resulting matrix is returned as the final output.

#### Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def findMatrix(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        counter = Counter(nums)

        result = []
        for _ in range(max(counter.values())):
            array = []
            for num in counter.keys():
                if counter[num] > 0:
                    array.append(num)
                    counter[num] -= 1
            result.append(array)
        return result
```

#### Java
```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> findMatrix(int[] nums) {
        int[] arr = new int[nums.length+1]; //we are said that nums[i] does not exceed nums.length

        int maxi = 0;
        for(int num : nums){
            arr[num]++;
            maxi = Math.max(maxi, arr[num]);
        }

        List<List<Integer>> list = new ArrayList<>();
        while(maxi > 0){
            List<Integer> temp = new ArrayList<>();
            for(int i=0; i<arr.length; i++){
                if(arr[i] > 0){
                    temp.add(i);
                    arr[i]--;
                }
            }
            list.add(temp);
            maxi--;
        }

        return list;        
    }
}
```
