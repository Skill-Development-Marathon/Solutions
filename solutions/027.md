# [2574. Left and Right Sum Differences](https://leetcode.com/problems/left-and-right-sum-differences/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, find a **0-indexed** integer array 
`answer` where:

- `answer.length == nums.length.`
- `answer[i] = |leftSum[i] - rightSum[i]|.`

Where:

- `leftSum[i]` is the sum of elements to the left of the index `i` in the 
array `nums`. If there is no such element, `leftSum[i] = 0`.
- `rightSum[i]` is the sum of elements to the right of the index `i` in the
array `nums`. If there is no such element, `rightSum[i] = 0`.
Return the array `answer`.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [10,4,8,3]
Output: [15,1,11,22]
Explanation: The array leftSum is [0,10,14,22] and the array rightSum is [15,11,3,0].
The array answer is [|0 - 15|,|10 - 11|,|14 - 3|,|22 - 0|] = [15,1,11,22].
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [1]
Output: [0]
Explanation: The array leftSum is [0] and the array rightSum is [0].
The array answer is [|0 - 0|] = [0].
```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 105`

## Solutions

### O(n) solution

The given algorithm takes a list of integers `nums` as input and returns a list of integers representing the absolute differences between the sum of elements on the left and right sides of each element in the `nums` list.

1. The algorithm defines a class `Solution` with a method `leftRightDifference` that takes `nums` as a parameter and returns a list of integers.

2. Inside the `leftRightDifference` method, the algorithm initializes three variables:
   - `right` is set to 0, representing the cumulative sum of elements on the right side.
   - `left_sum` is set to the sum of all elements in `nums`, representing the cumulative sum of all elements on the left side.
   - `answer` is initialized as an empty list, which will store the absolute differences for each element.

3. The algorithm starts a loop that iterates over each element `num` in the `nums` list.

4. Within the loop, the algorithm updates the `right` variable by adding the current element `num` to it, representing the cumulative sum on the right side.

5. The algorithm appends the absolute difference between `right` and `left_sum` to the `answer` list using the `append` method. This represents the absolute difference between the cumulative sums on the left and right sides of the current element.

6. The algorithm updates the `left_sum` variable by subtracting the current element `num` from it, representing the cumulative sum on the left side after moving to the next element.

7. After iterating over all the elements in `nums`, the algorithm returns the `answer` list containing the absolute differences for each element.

**Complexity Analysis**

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input list `nums`. This is because the algorithm iterates over each element once to calculate the cumulative sums and absolute differences.

The space complexity is O(n), as the algorithm stores the absolute differences for each element in the `answer` list, which can have a size equal to the length of the input list `nums`.

#### Python3
```python3
class Solution:
    def leftRightDifference(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        right, left_sum, answer = 0, sum(nums), []
        for num in nums:
            right += num
            answer.append(abs(right-left_sum))
            left_sum -= num
        return answer
```
#### TypeScript

``` typescript
function leftRightDifference(nums: number[]): number[] {
    const answer = [];
    const rightSums = [];
    const leftSums = [];
    const length = nums.length;
    for(let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if(i === 0) {
            leftSums.push(0);
            rightSums.push(0);
        } else {
            leftSums.push(leftSums[i - 1] + nums[i - 1]);
            rightSums.unshift(nums[nums.length - i] + rightSums[0])
        }
    }
    for(let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        answer[i] = Math.abs(leftSums[i] - rightSums[i])
    }
    return answer
};
```
