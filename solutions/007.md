# [1342. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-steps-to-reduce-a-number-to-zero/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

Given an integer num, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero.
In one step, if the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**
```text
Input: num = 14
Output: 6
Explanation: 
Step 1) 14 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 7. 
Step 2) 7 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 6.
Step 3) 6 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 3. 
Step 4) 3 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 2. 
Step 5) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1. 
Step 6) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.

```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: num = 8
Output: 4
Explanation: 
Step 1) 8 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 4. 
Step 2) 4 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 2. 
Step 3) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1. 
Step 4) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: num = 123
Output: 12
```

## Constraints:

- `0 <= num <= 106`


## Solutions

### Simple O(1) solution
We iterate using while untill given number `num` became `0`. In each step 
we check does `num` is devisiable by `2`. If it does we devide `num` by `2` and
increment `step` variable by `1`. Otherwise, we subtract `1` from `num` and 
increment `step`.

#### Python
```python3
class Solution:
    def numberOfSteps(self, num: int) -> int:
        steps = 0
        while num:
            if num % 2:
                num -= 1
            else:
                num //= 2
            steps += 1
        return steps
```

#### GO
```go
func numberOfSteps(num int) int {
   count := 0
   for num > 0 {
       if num%2 == 0 {
           num = num/2
       } else {
           num = num - 1
       }
       count++
   } 
   return count
}
```

#### PHP
```
class Solution {

    /**
     * @param Integer $num
     * @return Integer
     */
    function numberOfSteps($num) {
        $step = 0;

        while($num){
            if($num%2 == 1){
                $num-=1;
            }else{
                $num/=2;
            }
            $step++;
        }

        return $step;
    }
}
```
