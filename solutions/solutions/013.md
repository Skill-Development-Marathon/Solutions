# [2520. Count the Digits That Divide a Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-digits-that-divide-a-number/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

Given an integer `num`, return the number of digits in `num` that divide `num`.

An integer `val` divides nums if `nums % val == 0`.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: num = 7
Output: 1
Explanation: 7 divides itself, hence the answer is 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: num = 121
Output: 2
Explanation: 121 is divisible by 1, but not 2. Since 1 occurs twice as a digit, we return 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: num = 1248
Output: 4
Explanation: 1248 is divisible by all of its digits, hence the answer is 4.
```

## Constraints:
- `1 <= num <= 109` 
- `num` does not contain `0` as one of its digits.


## Solutions

### Simple solution 

#### Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def countDigits(self, num: int) -> int:
        original, total = num, 0
        while num:
            n = num % 10
            total += 0 if original % n else 1
            num //= 10
        return total
```

#### Ruby 

```ruby 
def count_digits(n) 
  n.digits.count { |digit| n % digit == 0 } 
end
```
