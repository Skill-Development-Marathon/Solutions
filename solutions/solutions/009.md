# [1480. Running Sum of 1d Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

Given an array `nums`. We define a running sum of an array as `runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i])`.
Return the running sum of `nums`.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,6,10]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1].
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: nums = [3,1,2,10,1]
Output: [3,4,6,16,17]
```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000` 
- `-10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`


## Solutions

We need to iterate over existing array of elements and update number at position with
sum of previously seen numbers. In order to keep previously seen numbers sum we need to
keep `current` by adding `num` at position. 

### O(n) solution

#### Solution in Python3
```python3
class Solution(object):
    def runningSum(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        current = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            num = nums[i]
            nums[i] += current
            current += num
        return nums
```
